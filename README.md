# ðŸ§¬ Amino Acid Converter ðŸ§¬

This code can convert peptide sequences between two different types of amino acid nomenclature. 

This is a useful tool for chemists and biologists who wish to convert from 3-letter to 1-letter sequences, or vice-versa. This can be necessary for using certain software, where the nomenclature used determines whether a sequence is N->C terminus or C->N terminus.

At the moment, this code just converts one sequence at a time.
